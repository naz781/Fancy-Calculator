#FANCY CALCULATOR v1.0


##APP SUMMARY

An aesthetically pleasing and functional calculator application was created by integrating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the "Fancy-Calculator" project. A dynamic display, buttons to toggle sound, and other arithmetic operations are all defined by HTML. Gradients, transparency effects, and animated buttons are just a few of the modern design elements that CSS adds to the interface. To guarantee real-time updates and user interaction feedback, JavaScript handles the calculation logic, input handling, and sound effects. Offering a powerful tool for basic computations with features like digit limit management and customizable sound options, the project prioritizes simplicity, usability, and aesthetic appeal.
